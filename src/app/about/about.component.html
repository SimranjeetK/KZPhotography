          <p>Throughout much of my adult life, Iâ€™ve been traveling, seeking adventure and ways
          to learn from and interact with cultures which are very different from my own. Photography became a great
          excuse to look deeper and to make my experiences more rich and intense.

          I usually find my subjects by chance, while I travel. But, I'm particularly drawn to ancient traditions
          which are still surviving and evolving. To stories of people working in unique, challenging environments
          and those who live in a close bond with nature.

          My main goal as a photographer is to create the kinds of images which combine a strong sense of story and
          convey what it felt like to be with the people I met in the places I visited.</p>
